# Things to do
- [ ] Look over the sql schema
  - [ ] Check to make sure the data type limitations match the specifications, ex PIN is 4 digits
  - [ ] Re-read the deliverable to make sure we are not violating anything
     - the CorkBoardItUser - might or might not be a violation, example uses `User` but that is a reserved word
- [ ] Look over eer-mapping
  - [ ] Check over typos
- [ ] Should we include visibility as an attribute if the corkboard is already a mandatory disjoint?
